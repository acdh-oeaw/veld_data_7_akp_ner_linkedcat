# NER Inference on linkedcat data from solr

This is the output data repository. The whole context of its inference can be found here: https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/veld_chain_9_akp_ner

There are two datasets on Solr: `linkedcat` (older) and `linkedcat2` (more recent and bigger). 

The two csv files here are their NER extractions with ML inference.
